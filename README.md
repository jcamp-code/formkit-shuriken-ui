# FormKit Shuriken UI

FormKit configs for integrating with [Shuriken UI](http://github.com/shuriken-ui/nuxt)

So this package is an opinionated config designed to replace FormKit's defaults with ShurikenUI, except in cases, in my opinin, where FormKit's inputs are considerably better.

#### ShurikenUI Components

- All Text (including native inputs)
- AutoComplete
- Textarea
- Checkbox
- Radio
- Dropdown
- Switch
- Datepicker (uses [vue3datepicker](https://vue3datepicker.com) for functionality)

#### FormKit Components With More Functionality Than ShurikenUI:

- ColorPicker (Pro)
- File

#### FormKit Components that don't exist in Shuriken:

- MultiStep
- TagList

#### Not Yet Styled

- Range
- Rating
- Repeater
- TransferList

** Will style these as needed **
